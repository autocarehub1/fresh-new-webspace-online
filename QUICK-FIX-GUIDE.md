# Quick Fix for 404 Driver Portal Error

## Step 1: Test Static File Serving
1. Go to: `https://catnetlogistics.com/test-routing.html`
2. If this shows a test page, static files are working
3. If this gives 404, your web root path is wrong

## Step 2: Check Your Web Root Path
Run this on your server to find where files are actually located:
```bash
find /var/www -name "index.html" 2>/dev/null
find /usr/share/nginx -name "index.html" 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 3: Update Nginx Configuration
1. SSH into your server
2. Replace your nginx config with the `simple-spa-nginx.conf` file
3. **IMPORTANT**: Update the `root` path in the config to match where your files actually are
4. Test and reload:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 4: Alternative Quick Fix
If you can't modify nginx config, add this to your index.html in the `<head>` section:
```html
<script>
  // Handle direct access to routes
  if (window.location.pathname !== '/' && !window.location.pathname.includes('.')) {
    const path = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', '/');
    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      window.history.pushState(null, '', path);
      window.dispatchEvent(new PopStateEvent('popstate'));
    });
  }
</script>
```

## Step 5: Verify Fix
Test these URLs directly:
- https://catnetlogistics.com/driver-auth
- https://catnetlogistics.com/tracking
- https://catnetlogistics.com/services

All should load the React app, not show 404 errors.

## Common Issues:
1. **Wrong web root path** - Files not where nginx expects them
2. **Missing try_files directive** - Server doesn't know to fallback to index.html
3. **Caching issues** - Browser/CDN serving old 404 pages
4. **File permissions** - Nginx can't read the files

## Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Check where nginx thinks files should be
nginx -T | grep root

# Verify file permissions
ls -la /var/www/html/dist/
```
